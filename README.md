This repo is for "invest-lang" a language in progress.

I'm not sure how useful the language will be.

`investlang/` contains the lexer which is generated by `flex`,
the parser will likely be written in C++.

`terminal/` will end up being a Qt implementation of the terminal.

But, I intend on having a normal non-GUI implementation of the terminal first.

`invest-lang` is intended to be a high-level language for management of assets,
finance, investment, etc. I hope to come up with a better name.
